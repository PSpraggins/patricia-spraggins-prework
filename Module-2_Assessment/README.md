# Hangman - Country Music

Hangman - Country Music is an online game. The player guesses letters to try to guess the artist name. If they get it correct before their 12 guesses are up, it alerts that they got it correct, a song by that artist pops up and it goes to the next word. If they get it wrong, it alerts them and goes to the next word. Win or lose, an image of the last artist appears.
